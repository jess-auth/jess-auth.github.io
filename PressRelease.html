                                    <p>Prior to Derivation's acquisition by Linedata in 2016, I was responsible for writing our press releases and publishing them on our website. Below is a sample press release, originally published on the 18<sup>th</sup> May 2012.</p>
                                    
                                    <h2>Derivation Releases New Two-Way FIX Messaging Feature for New York Investment Bank Client</h2>
                                    
                                    <p>Derivation recently released a new two-way FIX messaging feature for a long standing client in New York.</p>

                                    <p>Supporting FIX places Derivation at the forefront of the financial software market. The Financial Information Exchange Protocol is a set of specifications for the communication of electronic trade-related messages. It is the financial market's leading trade-communications protocol and as such is 'altering the face of the global financial services sector.' Used to communicate in a transparent, time and cost efficient manner, FIX is becoming an integral part of daily communications in the financial industry.</p>

                                    <p>This is one of many development projects completed for this client with whom Derivation has enjoyed a strong relationship over the years, absorbing feedback into a flexible development plan. Supporting FIX messaging has three main benefits and it is for these reasons that the client requested Derivation support it. The first is that it provides a seamless and direct link to other systems both speeding up communications and allowing greater accuracy. Secondly, the user may view confirmations and errors from other systems without leaving Derivation. It therefore allows clear and straightforward control over the workflow from order to trade entirely within Derivation. The third benefit is that all of this aids greatly in meeting compliance requirements. Fast communication allows trades to be reported to Bloomberg TRACE without fault and in a matter of seconds. Derivation supporting FIX has had a direct positive effect on daily communications processes saving the client time, effort and error.</p>

                                    <p>Over the last few years the Derivation development campus has dedicated a great deal of time catering to many new compliance requisites. They have been working on SOX IT Security Compliance measures along with features such as audit trails and automated reporting which help meet requirements laid out by the Doddâ€“Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.</p>

                                    <p>Overall, Derivation's strongly client-driven approach to development allows input from a wide variety of firms in different markets and countries, helping them to stay at the very forefront of innovation wherever they are.</p>
