										<h1>Keep calm and carry on: Moving to a Post-ICO marketing strategy</h1>
                                        </header>
                                        <p>Congratulations! After months of campaigning, your initial coin offering is finally over. You’ve created a large, enthusiastic following through your pre-ICO marketing strategy, met your capital target, and are ready to get product development fully underway. Although it’s natural to want to relax your marketing efforts and enjoy the buzz of success, don’t rest too long on your laurels. Moving on to a considered post-ICO marketing strategy will help maintain momentum and investor interest until your product is ready for release.</p>
                                        <h2>Allocating funds</h2> 
                                        <p>While it may be tempting to plunge all the capital invested through the ICO into product development, don’t forget to divide funds across all areas of your business, including marketing. An effective ongoing marketing strategy will need sufficient funding to sustain the campaign from ICO through to the product launch and beyond.</p>
                                        <h2>Maintaining communication with investors</h2> 
                                        <p>Your pre-ICO marketing campaign should have left you with a following of current and potential investors, who will be keen to know how your project is progressing. You should continue to focus on your message to this audience to maintain their interest. Consider your email marketing strategy carefully to provide regular updates and targeted campaigns. Your communications should be engaging and personal to your product, making sure that investors understand and believe in the solutions you will deliver.</p>
                                        <p>A strong social media strategy is vital in generating further confidence in your product. Engaging regularly with your audience via Facebook, Twitter or through AMAs (Ask Me Anything) on Reddit will allow you to provide direct answers to any questions as well as showcase the team behind your brand. Regular blog updates on your website or features on reputable financial news sites or cryptocurrency blogs will all help to inspire investor confidence.</p>
                                        <h2>Exchange Listing</h2> 
                                        <p>One of the first events to communicate with investors will be when your tokens are listed on exchanges for trading. There are many different exchanges out there (with 198 listed on <a href="https://cryptocoincharts.info/markets/info">CryptoCoinCharts</a> as of June 2018), all with differences in their fee structure and their criteria for selecting which tokens to list. For example, <a href="https://www.bitfinex.com/">Bitfinex</a> lists factors such as “user requests, shareholder interest, market capitalization … and a thorough assessment of the token’s development process” as key to their decision-making process<sup><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup>. Research carefully and aim to target the exchanges which are the best fit for your product.</p>
                                        <h2>Post-ICO Bounty Programs</h2> 
                                        <p>Bounty programs need not be restricted to pre-ICO campaigns. Leveraging tokens post-ICO can be another way to keep stakeholders engaged after the initial offering. Advertising ICO bounty programs through companies such as <a href="https://icobounty.io/">ICO Bounty</a> will provide new exposure for your product, and attract attention from new investors. Tokens can be offered as rewards for bug hunting or for translating your documentation into other languages, helping generate new interest and further expanding your business into new territories.</p>
                                        <p>As you can see, there are a number of points to consider when planning your post-ICO marketing strategy. While you could implement your plans in-house, an ICO marketing agency can add vital extra experience and expertise. With their help, you can design a cost-effective marketing strategy which will be right for your business now and over the long-term.</p>
